# [Alzheimer's Detection using CNN](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hassaneskikri/alzhaimer-detection/notebook)

## Overview
This project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNN) to detect signs of Alzheimer's disease from imaging data. The system employs deep learning algorithms to analyze brain scans and assist in early diagnosis. The project is organized into data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation stages.

## Features
- End-to-end deep learning pipeline for Alzheimer detection.
- Data preprocessing and augmentation for improved model robustness.
- CNN-based model training and evaluation.
- Visualization of training performance and results.
